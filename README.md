# Hate-Crime-Analysis

A Hate crime (also known as a bias-motivated crime or bias crime) is a prejudice motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of their membership (or perceived membership) of a certain social group or racial demographic. 
A Hate Crime is defined as 'Any criminal offense which is perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person's race or perceived race; religion or perceived religion; sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation; disability or perceived disability and any crime motivated by hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived transgender.'


In this project we will be doing the analysis on the hate crimes taking place in different places. From this we will come to know a great insights regarding this crime which can help to reduce the number of hate crimes taking place. We will do some analysis using python and then build an attractive dashboard using powerbi to know more about the problem.
